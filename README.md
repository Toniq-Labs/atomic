# atomIC
This is a Cross-chain atomic bridge - allowing users to move digital assets through different blockchains via a secure atomic transfer using smart contracts. Assets moves cross-chain will exist on-chain in Secured Reserve Contracts (SRCs) and can be reclaimed via a reverse atomic transfer in future.
